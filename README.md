I have made a framework using Scala and cucumber.  this is the link : https://github.com/purnimashanti/valtech-frontend.git

To run : install sbt and scala.

open the project in the intellij and setup a junit runner in intellij.
The feature files has all the 3 scenarios with expected results. The step definitions are in the steps folder.
Each html pages are represented with a class file  ex: HomePage. In each page, the url and header and h1 tag are used for assertions.
ScalaTest methods are used to find the elements.
